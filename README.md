# MapsApp 🗺️

Welcome to MapsApp! This project was developed with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and utilizes [expo-location](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/location/) to provide GPS services for location-based features.

## About the Project

MapsApp is designed to showcase GPS functionality by accessing the user’s location in real-time. It includes features that allow users to view their current location on a map, explore nearby locations, and navigate with ease. The app makes use of expo-location to handle permissions and access device GPS data.

## Running the App

To explore the app:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   You’ll see options to open the app in:

   - An [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - An [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) for viewing on a physical device

> **Note:** GPS services require appropriate permissions to work correctly. Make sure to grant location permissions when prompted.
